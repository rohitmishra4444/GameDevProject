Escape the Stone Age
====================

Source Code for an Android Game developed during a semester at the University of Fribourg for the course *Design and Graphics Programming for Game Development*.

If you want to try the game, download the Android .apk file from SourceForge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/escapethestoneage/files/

The game requires at least Android version 2.2 (API 8), since OpenGL ES 2.0 was introduced then.
It works fine on Android version 4.0.3 or higher and *should* also work on versions between 2.2 and 4.0.3, but we have not tested it.

Story
